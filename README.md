Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

         - Software Engineering is the sytematic application of Engineering Principles, Methods and tools to solve develop and maintain high quality software sytems.
         - Software Engineering is essential since it has enabled people to create software/Applications that power the modern aspects of life.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

         a. The development of programming languages such such structured programming, which enbled software engnineers to write code that run on compilers
         b. Establishment of software engineering as a discpline in 1960 which enable people to recognise and venture deeper into software engineering
         c. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s which has enabled engineers to choose have rapid development of computer system with a choosen siimple methodolgy.
            

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

         a, Requirements specification - The Programmer gathers information and documents the user needs and system requirements
         b, System Design - The User designs the architect of the prospective software such as the user interface
         c, system Implemantaion - using The design specifications to write code that will later be implemented to the final system
         System testing - using different system testing such as dry running to debug the code and make sure it is error free.
         d,Deployment  - releasing the software to the final users /customers
         e,System maintenance - Providing future enhancements and updates to the current system to meet the current user needs 



4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

         in Waterfall Methodolgy there is distinct flow of each programme phase making sure each phase is complete before proceeding to the next phase from the top downwards
         there is iterative approach and incremental approach to each phase making whereas the user can still go back to previous phase and add futures to amke it more complete

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

         Software developer is reponsible for wrting code and implementing software solutions
         Quality Assurance engineer is reponsible for the quality of software by testing and ensuring the software meets the required standards.
         project manager is responsible for oversseing the planning, execution and delivery of software systems

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    intergrated develoment environments are softwares that are designed to help programmers in ; 
                     write code in the desired programming language
                     debug any code and detecting errors in code 
                     testing codes to make sure they are error free before execution examples are visual studio code and pycharm.

      Version control sytems are software systems essential in software development since they;
      they help track changes in source code and help in coordination among team members 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

                     Tight deadlines which pressure developers to deliver software within tight schedules of time.
                      Technical  debt which increases the maintenance cost
                      Changing requirements 
         These challenges can be overcome by;
                           Reassesments of project goals and timelines 
                           The use of agile methologies
                           Prioritazation oF Tasks
                           and effective communication


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Tests individual components (functions, methods, or classes) in isolation.
                  importance
                  Catches bugs early in development.
                  Facilitates code refactoring with minimal risk.

Integration - Tests how different modules or components work together.Verifies interfaces and interactions between the integrated parts.
                  importance
                -  Ensures that modules work as a cohesive system.
               -   Helps detect integration issues that unit tests may miss.

System testing- Tests the entire software system as a complete entity
                   importance
               -   Ensures the software operates correctly in its full environment.
              -    Confirms that all components work together as expected.
               -   Helps identify any performance, security, or usability issues.

Acceptance testing -  Validates the software against user requirements or business needs. 
                  Importance:
              -    Confirms the software is ready for release.
              -    Increases client satisfaction by aligning with their expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering




Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
