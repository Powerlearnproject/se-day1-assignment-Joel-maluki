# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software Engineering is the sytematic application of Engineering Principles, Methods and tools to solve develop and maintain high quality software sytems.
- Software Engineering is essential since it has enabled people to create software/Applications that power the modern aspects of life.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

a. The development of programming languages such such structured programming, which enbled software engnineers to write code that run on compilers
b. Establishment of software engineering as a discpline in 1960 which enable people to recognise and venture deeper into software engineering
c. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s which has enabled engineers to choose have rapid development of computer system with a choosen siimple methodolgy.
   

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

a, Requirements specification - The Programmer gathers information and documents the user needs and system requirements
b, System Design - The User designs the architect of the prospective software such as the user interface
c, system Implemantaion - using The design specifications to write code that will later be implemented to the final system
System testing - using different system testing such as dry running to debug the code and make sure it is error free.
d,Deployment  - releasing the software to the final users /customers
e,System maintenance - Providing future enhancements and updates to the current system to meet the current user needs 



4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.





Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.





Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.





What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.





Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.





#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering




Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
